# Suggestions #

* Thanks to [SÅ‚awomir Nowak](https://github.com/slnowak) for the suggestion about having two versions of `get`--the
checked and unchecked one--and for adapting the API to Java 7 using [Google Guava](https://github.com/google/guava).
You can find this alternative version in the `jdk7-support` branch.
